                <p class="text-body fw-light lh-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    The basic task is to predict the next position given a trajectory sequence (prediction task).
                    Fusing GPS and POI data, the paper proposed image-like embedding of POIs to represent a trajectory like an artificial video.
                    This enables transfer learning to exploit other cities with limited observation data. 
                    An LSTM-on-CNNs architecture is designed to capture both spatio-temporal and geographical information.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body fw-light lh-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    One tricky and interesting point for me is the construction of POI-image. 
                    Different POI categories serve as different channels, while the value of a pixel is the number of POI of one category in one mesh (It means that all pixel values will not change along the time). 
                    Trajectories are used as capture frame (location meshes + window meshes) to generate the video clips. 
                    The main intuition is to mine sequential relationships of POIs.
                    One potential problem in my opinion is the inefficient use of the expensive trajectory data.

                    The background is location prediction task given trajectory history in this paper. 
                    The place representation matrix is obtained from an LSTM-RNN using stay point sequences generated from GPS data. 
                    All three proposed models are based on this representation. 
                    The most preferred model is to train a transformation function to map representation in the common vector space. 
                    The author also develops another two models for comparison. 
                    One is simply merging mobility data from two cities and training representation together. 
                    Another is to train the adversarial model.

                    Due to the unsupervised learning setting, the paper uses the top-N visited place pairs to train the mapping function, which may be problematic in my opinion. 
                    Moreover, the representation matrix deal with embeddings of stay points, which may be expensive and difficult to learn an accurate mapping function.

                    The paper utilizes an expectation-maximation (EM) algorithm to estimate intercity spatial mapping. 
                    The intercity trajectory matching is seen as latent variables and the intercity spatial mapping as the parameters. 
                    Then, a Gibbs sampling multiple hidden Markov model utilizes the Viterbi algorithm to generate simulated trajectories using the generated spatial mapping.

                    In my opinion, even though the idea of not using any prior knowledge is fascinating, simply matching trajectories and estimating optimal parameters can be computationally expensive and difficult to converge.

                    The paper proposes a non-sequential non-parametric generative model to capture high-order geographic and semantic features of human mobility. 
                    It uses the matrix to represent one discretized location and each cell contains information about the time and duration of visiting that cell in the given trajectory. 
                    The third dimension of the matrix (tensor) is the repeated times of visiting the same location. The paper uses the generative adversarial networks to train the model.

                <p class="text-body fw-light lh-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    The idea of non-parametric is very fascinating since it is difficult to find a comprehensive and sound approach to model the human mobility. 
                    The proposed method “compresses” the time dimension. 
                    However, it also sacrifices the ability of explaining the patterns in human knowledge.

                    The task of human mobility is the prediction task. 
                    The paper constructs multimodal embeddings for current and historical trajectories. 
                    Then the embeddings are fed into a Recurrent Neural Network. 
                    A historical attention module between historical and current trajectories is used to capture multilevel periodicity. 
                    The paper proposes two different attention candidate generators: one is to directly embed records into independent latent vectors and sample for candidates, while another is to sequentially encode and take intermediate outputs as candidates. 
                    The workflow of architecture dealing with sequential data is typical. One interesting point is that the paper examines the attention matrix to explain the effectives.

                <p class="text-body fw-light lh-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    However, in my opinion, the explanation is shallow since it only focuses on the maximum weight to prove it. 
                    More elaborations are needed in this part. 
                    Moreover, even though the author uses multimodal embeddings, the multimodal information is just location, user ID and time, which may not be so powerful. 
                    And conversion from one-hot vectors to dense vectors may be unable to capture complicated features.

                    The task of the paper is the prediction of urban flow based on historical data. 
                    The resolution is high (The grid size is ~150m), which is called as fine-grained. 
                    The author selects key timesteps as closeness, period and trend (recent, daily and weekly) to create different layers of the flow inputs, and uses non-shared convolutional layer to process them. 
                    The external factors (like weather and time) and POI information are processed by the meta learner. 
                    All four layers are concatenated and fed into a network to get high-dimensional embeddings for each grid. 
                    To reduce the parameters due to the fine-grained settings, the author develops region partition and uses a Graph Neural Network to consider global spatial dependencies and make predictions.

                <p class="text-body fw-light lh-3" style="text-align: justify">
                    In all, it is a very good paper for the comprehensive use of mobility data and the consideration of the external factors as embeddings. 
                    The paper gives a very clear description of the architecture. 
                    One of problem in my opinion is the usage of fine-grained data, as it is expensive and easy to violate privacy. 
                    Moreover, the setting of GCN may be not convincing because the complete graph may not describe the actual connections between different regions.

                    The target is to study competitive relationships of POIs. 
                    The author summarizes POIs and construct graphs (which means generation of edges between POIs) in two aspects. 
                    First is the spatial relationship through heat maps. 
                    Second is the aspect relationship extracted from reviews and search histories.

                    Then these two graphs are fed into the network to predict competitive relationships through spatial and knowledge sides. 
                    For the spatial side, to consider two spatial factors, different location sectors and distance, the paper designs different convolution layers for different sectors and an attentive propagation layer by assigning distance into different buckets. 
                    Moreover, the competitive and compensative graphs are operated separately and concatenated in the end. 
                    For the knowledge side, the brand and aspect embeddings are learned using specific aggregation functions. 
                    Brands and Aspects are interacted by cross attention.

                    The interesting point of the paper is usage of multinomial data, including reviews, search histories and spatial relationship of POIs. 
                    How they convert POIs into graph structure is also a good point to consider different factors hierarchically. 
                    Even though the paper is not about mobility using POI information, it is a good hint for delineation of POI interactions.
